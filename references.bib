 abstract = {Computer simulations had suggested that the strategy that maximises the score on each turn in the dice game described by Roters (1998) may not be the optimal way to reach a given target in the shortest time. We give an analytical treatment, backed by numerical calculations, that finds the optimal strategy to reach such a target.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider an explicit solution of an optimal stopping problem arising in connection with a dice game. An optimal stopping rule and the maximum expected reward in this problem can easily be computed by means of the distributions involved and the specific rules of the game.},
